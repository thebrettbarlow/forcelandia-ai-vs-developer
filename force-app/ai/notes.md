# Notes

Contains miscellaneous notes about using AI to solve the coding challenge.

Asking a specific question about something that references documentation has
mixed results. For example, when asked about which endpoints to use from
https://untappd.com/api/docs - it mostly made stuff up or responded with
descriptions of things. Only 1 time did it respond with exactly what I was
hoping for.

At first, I attempted to assemble a team and have an "architect" design the
solution and delegate the build to "developers". This had mixed results and I
spent most of the time fighting with the responses.
